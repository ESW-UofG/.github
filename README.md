## Frontend

The frotend will be done in React. Most of the logic is already in the files I have created. Basically there will be 3 pages:
<ul>
    <li>Home Page</li>
    <li>Player's Page</li>
    <li>Hash's page</li>
</ul>

## Backend

QR Code generation will also generate a hash. First,
this hash is sent to an API. The API stores this hash on it's database. This record is valid because it is generated by us and allows us to prove authenticity of a hash.

The user will be redirected to a URL like: https://oursite/ourhash/pts

Once our user is redirected to this link, they are asked for their email. The hash is checked against the API, and then is checked against the actual storage database ("A handshake"). If everything checks out...
<ul>
    <li>If the player is not in the table, create a record and increase their score by 1</li>
    <li>If the player is in the table, increase the score by 1</li>
    <li>Regardless of state, store the hash</li>
</ul>

What's nice about the URL generation is that it's super customizable and easily scalable. If we wanted to use it for another game, we could simply set it as:

- https://oursite/other_game/ourhash

and then when checking the url we could store this info in the other game's database table.
